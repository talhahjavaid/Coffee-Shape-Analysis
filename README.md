### RECOMMENDATIONS
#### Product Categories:
- The business should focus on promoting and expanding their top-selling product categories: coffee, tea, bakery, and drinking chocolate. These categories generate the most revenue for the business.
- It should carryout customer survey to understand why customers dont purchase  coffee beans, loose tea, flavors, branded, and packaged chocolate. These categories do not generate as much revenue and may not be worth the time and resources to continue selling.
- It may decide to improve on the taste/flavors of these products, offer discounts and improve advertising coverage for these products

#### Sales Trends:
- The business should develop strategies to increase sales during the slower months of January and February. These are the two slowest months for the business, so finding ways to boost sales during these times is crucial.
- It should continue to focus on growth during the peak sales months of March to June. These are the three months when the business makes the most money, so capitalizing on this time is essential.

#### Store Locations:
- The business should explore opportunities to expand or enhance their Hell's Kitchen location to capitalize on its high sales performance. This location is the top performer, making it an ideal candidate for investment.
- It should implement strategies to increase sales at their Astoria and Lower Manhattan locations to improve their performance relative to Hell's Kitchen. These two locations do not perform as well as Hell's Kitchen, so finding ways to boost their sales is necessary.

#### Sales Days:
- The business should leverage marketing and promotional efforts to capitalize on the higher sales days of Monday, Thursday, and Friday. These are the days when customers are most likely to shop, so ensuring they are reached with marketing messages is crucial.
- It should develop strategies to boost sales on Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays to reduce the sales gap between these days and the higher-sales days. These are the days when sales are lowest, more research is needed to find out why  customers do not visit the shop more on these days is essential.

#### Top 5 Selling Products:
- The business should continue to promote and stock their top-selling products: Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai tea, Hot Chocolate, Gourmet brewed coffee, and Brewed black tea. These products are most interesting to customers, so ensuring their availability is essential.
- It business should consider developing new products or variations of their top-selling products to maintain customer interest and drive sales. This will help keep customers coming back for more.

#### Bottom 5 Selling Products:
- The business should analyze the reasons why their bottom-selling products are not performing well. There may be various reasons, such as poor placement, lack of marketing, or high prices.
- It should should develop strategies to improve on the least selling products, it should carry out customer survey to better understand customer preferences and why customers are not purchasing these products.
- Alternatively, It business should consider discontinuing or reducing their focus on these products if there are no clear strategies to improve their sales. Focusing on products that generate revenue is more efficient.

### Additional Recommendations
- The business should gather additional customer feedback to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs. This will help develop products and services that customers will love.
- It  should analyze customer demographics to identify potential target markets for specific products or promotions. This will help reach the right customers with the right message.
- It should monitor industry trends and competitor activities to stay ahead of the competition. Identifying opportunities to grow the business is crucial.

### Limitations
  I had to remove the transaction date column using excel because the date format was not compatible with postgreSQL.
